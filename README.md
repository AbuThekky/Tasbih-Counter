# Tasbih Counter

## About

The point of this program is to track the suplications you make after 
salah (prayer). You start by saying: "Subhan Allah" (سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّٰهِ; lit. "Glory be to God") x 33 times. 33 repetitions of ʾallāhu ʾakbaru (ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ), meaning "God is Greater [than everything]". Finally, 33 repetitions of al-ḥamdu lillāhi (ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ), meaning "All praise is due to God".
